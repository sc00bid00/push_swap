# Project Title: Push Swap

## Description:
Push Swap is a 42 School project that involves sorting a stack of numbers using two stacks and a set of predefined operations. The goal is to implement an efficient sorting algorithm that can arrange the numbers in ascending order using the fewest possible operations. This project hones your problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and coding abilities.

## Key Features:
- Sorting algorithm implementation using two stacks.
- Minimizing the number of operations to sort the stack.
- Detailed project instructions and requirements provided by 42 School.

## Technologies Used:
- C programming language.

## Project Highlights:
- Developed a highly efficient sorting algorithm for stacks.
- Implemented various stack manipulation operations.
- Utilized data structures and algorithms to optimize the sorting process.
- Demonstrated strong problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

## How to Use:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the program using the provided Makefile.
3. Run the program with a list of numbers as arguments to see it in action

## Acknowledgments:
This project was completed as part of the 42 School curriculum. Thanks to 42 for providing the opportunity to work on this challenging project. As usual particular thanks to (abc order): Kathrin, Max, Rouven. You inspired, challenged and supported me, even in the darkest crazy visualizer moments... I love you all.
